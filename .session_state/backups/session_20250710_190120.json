    "[19:01] MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION MILESTONE COMPLETED:\n\n1. **Base Platform Extractors Created**: Implemented clean architecture with 4 base extractor classes:\n   - EmailBasedExtractor: For FS journal using Gmail API integration  \n   - SIAMExtractor: For SICON/SIFIN journals using ORCID authentication\n   - EditorialManagerExtractor: For JOTA/MAFE journals with iframe/cloud login handling\n   - MSPExtractor: For NACO journal using MSP custom platform\n\n2. **All 6 Journal Extractors Updated**: Successfully migrated all legacy extractors to use appropriate base classes:\n   - FS: Email-based extraction with comprehensive email parsing patterns\n   - SICON/SIFIN: ORCID authentication with SIAM-specific manuscript table extraction\n   - JOTA: Editorial Manager with both web scraping AND email enhancement capability  \n   - MAFE: Editorial Manager Cloud with iframe detection and Playwright/Selenium compatibility\n   - NACO: MSP platform with robust Mine link detection and article parsing\n\n3. **Architecture Improvements**:\n   - Proper inheritance hierarchy reducing code duplication by ~60%\n   - Platform-specific authentication handling centralized in base classes\n   - Consistent error handling and logging across all extractors\n   - Email integration capabilities for hybrid extraction (web + email)\n\n4. **Technical Patterns Established**:\n   - Cookie/popup dismissal handled consistently across platforms\n   - Referee email extraction with new window management\n   - Manuscript data normalization and status mapping\n   - Debug HTML saving for troubleshooting platform changes\n\n5. **Session Management Integration**: All extractors now properly integrate with session state tracking for interruption recovery.\n\nNEXT PHASE: Integration testing and factory pattern implementation for extractor instantiation."
