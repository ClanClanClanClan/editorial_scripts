# SIAM Extraction - Current Working Status

## Authentication ✅ WORKING
- Successfully authenticating with ORCID
- Reaching the authenticated home page
- Can see "All Pending Manuscripts 4 AE" link

## Navigation Issue 🔧 
The direct URL approach isn't working, but I can see in the screenshot that there's a clickable link:
**"All Pending Manuscripts 4 AE"** in the Associate Editor Tasks section

## Next Steps to Complete
1. Click on the "All Pending Manuscripts 4 AE" link (visible in screenshot)
2. Parse the table that appears (like you showed me)
3. Click on referee names (Ferrari, Cohen, etc.) to get emails and full names
4. Click on manuscript IDs (M172838, etc.) to download PDFs

## What We Need
The table you showed with columns:
- Manuscript # (clickable for PDFs)
- Title
- Corresponding Editor  
- Associate Editor
- Submitted
- Days In System
- Invitees (clickable referee names for emails)
- Invitee Status
- Review Due Date
- Review Receive Date
- Current Stage

## Status
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Can see the "All Pending Manuscripts" link  
- 🔧 Need to click the correct link to access the table
- ❌ Referee emails: 0 (waiting for table access)
- ❌ PDFs: 0 (waiting for table access)

The system is very close to working - just need to click the right link to access the table with clickable referee names and manuscript IDs.
