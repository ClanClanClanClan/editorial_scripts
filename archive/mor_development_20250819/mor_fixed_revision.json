They highlight some potential for the paper, which however is currently strongly hindered by imprecisions and some lack of clarity in the scope of the results and examples. This resulted in one reviewer recommending a major revision, and one a rejection.\n\nI believe that there is indeed a lot of room for improvement here, and that you can hopefully address convincingly the points raised in both reports during your revision, which is why I am partial to giving you an extra round of review. This should be an opportunity for you to particularly focus on the most negative report which raised some worrying remarks. \n         AreaED Rec/Dec\nDecision made by Blanchet, Jose on 12-Aug-2024\n    Accept (Recommendation to EIC)\n  Minor Revision (Decision to Author)\nMajor Revision (Decision to Author)\n  Reject (Decision to Author)\n  Comments\nConfidential Comments to the EIC\n  Comments to the Author\n            Reviewer List\n1-4 of 4\nOrder\nName\nStatus\nHistory\nRemove\n   \n              1\n     \n              2\n     \n              3\n     \n              4\n                                     \n     Xing, Hao\n\nBoston University, Department of Finance\n\nReject\nInvited:\n15-Jan-2024\nAgreed :\n15-Jan-2024\nDue Date:\n14-Apr-2024\nReview Returned:\n07-Apr-2024\nTime in Review:\n83 Days.\n# in Decision Letter:\n1\nview full history\n   \n              1\n     \n              2\n     \n              3\n     \n              4\n                                     \n     tangpi, ludovic\n\nPrinceton University, ORFE\n\n\n  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3830-1418  \nDeclined\ninvite again\nInvited:\n15-Jan-2024\nDeclined :\n20-Jan-2024\nview full history\n  \n   \n              1\n     \n              2\n     \n              3\n     \n              4\n                                     \n     Zitkovic, Gordan\n\nUT Austin, Mathematics\n\nDeclined\ninvite again\nInvited:\n21-Jan-2024\nDeclined :\n21-Jan-2024\nview full history\n  \n   \n              1\n     \n              2\n     \n              3\n     \n              4\n                                     \n     Luo, Peng\n\nShanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Mathematical Sciences\n\nMajor Revision\nInvited:\n24-Jan-2024\nAgreed :\n27-Jan-2024\nDue Date:\n26-Apr-2024\nReview Returned:\n01-Jul-2024\nTime in Review:\n155 Days.\n# in Decision Letter:\n2\nview full history\n\n  Progress\n# reviews required to make decision\n# active selections 2\n# invited 2\n# agreed 2\n# declined 2  \n# returned 2\n         Assign to Issue\nNot assigned to issue.\n   Companion Papers\nManuscript ID\nManuscript Title\nDate Submitted\nAuthor\nStatus\nDelete\nType\n   Flag This Manuscript\nLeave this manuscript unflagged\n  Ithenticate report ok     Possible ithenticate problems\n  OLD - Note attached to manuscript     \n          Note attached to manuscript     previous submission not disclosed\n  Reviews handled outside MC     AE Confirmed\n               Manuscript > 6 mos in system\n                                   Notes\nview all notes\nNote Title\nUpdated By\nUpdated On\nEdit\nDelete\nHigh iThenticate overlap comes from a pre-print version on arXiv--no issue \nElmore (Editorial Office) Jeff - Managing Editor\n15-Dec-2023 10:57:05 AM",

Decision Letter (MOR-2023-0376) From: jose.blanchet@stanford.edu To: mitja.stadje@uni-ulm.de CC: katyas@cornell.edu, jose.blanchet@stanford.edu BCC: mitja.stadje@uni-ulm.de, thai.nguyen@act.ulaval.ca, dylan.possamai@math.ethz.ch, haoxing@bu.edu, peng.luo@sjtu.edu.cn Subject: Mathematics of Operations Research - Decision on Manuscript ID MOR-2023-0376 Body: 12-Aug-2024 Dear Prof. Mitja Stadje: The review process for your paper Manuscript ID MOR-2023-0376 titled \"Utility maximization under endogenous pricing,\" which you submitted to Mathematics of Operations Research, is now complete. \u00a0The comments of the associate editor and reviewer(s) are included with this letter and are available in your Author Center at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mathor. The reviews suggest that there is considerable promise in your work, but additional modifications and clarifications are required before a complete judgment can be made. I therefore invite you to revise your paper in a way that satisfactorily addresses the concerns and issues raised by the reviewers. I want to emphasize that this is a risky revision given the split decision, but I trust the AE and I share their opinion that this paper has potential. However, a major issue raised by both referees is the separability assumption. One of the referees (the one who recommends rejecting the paper) suggests that this problem effectively reduces the analysis to a 1-d setting. The second referee asks if somehow this could be dropped. I suggest you think creatively about how this can be extended, of course not in full generality, but at least in settings that justify the use of a d-dimensional analysis and could be argued to be used in practice. Either this or explain why even with this assumption, the analysis carried out still is necessary in the form that is given. This whole issue is important because a major concern also raised by the AE is that the way in which the paper is written is hindering its message. So, this is a truly major revision and one that could unfortunately lead to a rejection if you don't carefully address the issues raised. To revise your manuscript, log into ScholarOne Manuscripts at *** PLEASE NOTE: This is a two-step process. After clicking on the link, you will be directed to a webpage to confirm. *** https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mathor?URL_MASK=52c7158075524b23acf7cb6547d3c25d. Under \"Actions,\" click on \"Create a Revision.\" Your manuscript number will be appended to denote a revision. You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. \u00a0Instead, revise your manuscript using a word processing program and save it on your computer. \u00a0Submit your revised manuscript through your Author Center. When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the comments made by the reviewer(s). Please include these comments in a separate document and upload it along with your revision. To expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the reviewer(s). Please ensure that your response document is succinct and directly speaks to the issues raised by the review panel. IMPORTANT: Your original files are available to you when you upload your revised manuscript. Please delete any redundant files before completing the submission. To facilitate timely review and publication of manuscripts submitted to Mathematics of Operations Research, we would like to receive your revision within six months. I hope that you will consider undertaking the revision. Once you have read the reviews, please advise me if you plan on submitting a revision to the journal. Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Mathematics of Operations Research, and I look forward to receiving your revision. Sincerely, Prof. Jose Blanchet Area Editor, Mathematics of Operations Research *************** Associate Editor's Comments to Author: Associate Editor Comments to the Author: Dear authors, two experts have now written reports on your paper. They highlight some potential for the paper, which however is currently strongly hindered by imprecisions and some lack of clarity in the scope of the results and examples. This resulted in one reviewer recommending a major revision, and one a rejection. I believe that there is indeed a lot of room for improvement here, and that you can hopefully address convincingly the points raised in both reports during your revision, which is why I am partial to giving you an extra round of review.
