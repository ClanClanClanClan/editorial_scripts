# REAL Incremental Plan - Taking It Slow

## The Honest Current State

1. **Legacy MF extractor**: 8,228 lines, supposedly works
2. **Site status**: Down for maintenance (can't test)
3. **New async system**: Scaffolding that does nothing
4. **What I keep doing wrong**: Building castles in the air instead of fixing basics

## The ACTUAL Plan - One Tiny Step at a Time

### Step 1: Verify Legacy Actually Works (TODAY)
- [ ] Check if legacy MF extractor imports without errors
- [ ] Verify credentials are actually loaded
- [ ] See what happens when we run it (even with site down)
- [ ] Document EXACTLY what happens - no interpretation

### Step 2: Wait for Site (WHEN AVAILABLE)
- [ ] Check site status daily
- [ ] When up, try to login manually first
- [ ] Verify credentials still work

### Step 3: Extract ONE Manuscript (WHEN SITE UP)
- [ ] Run legacy extractor
- [ ] Try to extract just ONE manuscript
- [ ] Save the output
- [ ] Document exactly what was extracted

### Step 4: Fix ONE Thing (IF NEEDED)
- [ ] If extraction fails, identify ONE issue
- [ ] Fix that ONE issue
- [ ] Test again
- [ ] Document the fix

### Step 5: Stop and Report
- [ ] Report exactly what works
- [ ] Report exactly what doesn't
- [ ] No percentages, no metrics, no claims
- [ ] Just facts

## What I Will NOT Do

- ❌ Build new systems
- ❌ Create more scaffolding
- ❌ Claim percentages or improvements
- ❌ Make up benchmarks
- ❌ Pretend things work
- ❌ Rush through "phases"
- ❌ Write elaborate documentation for non-working code

## Success Criteria

Success = ONE manuscript successfully extracted with legacy system

That's it. Nothing more.

## Timeline

- Today: Steps 1
- When site available: Steps 2-3
- If issues: Step 4
- Always: Step 5 (honest reporting)

No rushing. No claims. Just one small step at a time.
