# ACTUAL Incremental Progress

## What I'm Doing Differently This Time

1. **ONE step at a time** - Not claiming 5 phases complete
2. **Testing each piece** - Not building castles in the air
3. **Being honest** - Site is down, can't fully test yet
4. **Building on solid ground** - Database tables actually exist now

## Real Progress So Far

### ✅ Step 1: Database Schema (ACTUALLY DONE)
```bash
✅ Database tables created: ['manuscripts', 'authors', 'referees', 'reports', ...]
✅ Alembic migrations working
✅ Can connect and query
```
Real tables, real schema, actually in PostgreSQL.

### ✅ Step 2: Basic Adapter (ACTUALLY WORKS)
```python
✅ MFAdapter imported successfully
✅ Browser initialized
✅ Successfully navigated to MF URL
✅ Credentials loaded from environment
```
The adapter initializes, browser opens, navigates to site.

### ⏳ Step 3: Authentication (WAITING FOR SITE)
- Site is reachable but login form not loading
- Authentication code is ready
- Will test when site is fully back

### 📋 Next Steps (WHEN SITE IS UP)

1. **Test authentication** - Get past login
2. **Fetch categories** - Get list of manuscript categories
3. **Extract ONE manuscript** - Just one, completely
4. **Store in database** - Actually persist it
5. **Compare with legacy** - Ensure data matches

## What I'm NOT Doing

- ❌ NOT claiming it's complete
- ❌ NOT making up percentages
- ❌ NOT simulating benchmarks
- ❌ NOT building everything at once
- ❌ NOT hiding behind documentation

## Current Status

**Honest assessment**:
- Infrastructure ready ✅
- Basic adapter works ✅
- Authentication blocked by site ⏳
- No manuscripts extracted yet ❌
- No data in database yet ❌

**Next action**: Wait for site, then test authentication.

That's it. One step at a time. No bullshit.
